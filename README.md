To keep my skills fresh, I created this React-Based 5 day weather forecast app using React and using fetch to access an API from openweathermap.org.  When the API contract runs out, i will try to renew it to keep it up and running, but I am limited to how many times I can access the API so i probably won't host this on github pages.  I will continue to update this.  My next task for this project will be to get an add location input, as this one is currently designated solely for my zip code.  Updates to come.

If you should wish to clone this, run 'npm install' and then 'npm start'.  It should open up on localhost3000.  The API is 'GET' only and the key will occasionally expire, so I recommend getting your own free key at openweathermap.org.

This uses React 17, JS, HTML, and CSS.
